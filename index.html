          <h2>Travel Options</h2>
          <p>We're excited to welcome you to our celebration! Here are the best ways to reach our venue:</p>

          <div class="accordion-header">By Air</div>

            <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <p>For those flying from the USA to Maastricht, you have three major international airports you can fly
                into:

                Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS)

                • Distance from Maastricht: About 2 hours by train (approximately 200 km).

                • Flight Details: Amsterdam Schiphol is the largest international airport in the Netherlands, offering
                numerous direct transatlantic flights to and from major cities across the USA.

                • Travel to Maastricht: From Schiphol, you can take a direct Intercity train to Maastricht Central
                Station, which takes around 2 hours. From there, you can use local transport (bus, taxi, or walking) to
                reach Van Oys.

                • Advantages: Schiphol is well-connected to major US cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.

                Brussels Airport (BRU)

                • Distance from Maastricht: About 1.5 hours by car (around 115 km).

                • Flight Details: Brussels offers direct flights to many U.S. cities, including New York, Chicago, and
                Washington D.C.

                • Travel to Maastricht: From Brussels Airport, you can take a train to Maastricht via Brussels Central
                Station (around 2-2.5 hours total). Alternatively, a private car or taxi could be a more direct option.

                • Advantages: As a major international hub, Brussels offers more flexibility with flight options.

                Frankfurt Airport (FRA)

                • Distance from Maastricht: Around 3 hours by car (approximately 230 km).

                • Flight Details: Frankfurt is a major international hub with direct transatlantic flights from many
                U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

                • Travel to Maastricht: From Frankfurt Airport, you can take a high-speed train (ICE) to Maastricht,
                which takes around 3.5 hours. Alternatively, a rental car or taxi could be used for more direct access.

                • Advantages: Frankfurt is one of Europe’s busiest airports, offering numerous flight options from the
                U.S.

                Travel Recommendations:
                • Best Option for Convenience: Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS) is the most convenient, as it has the most
                frequent connections to North America and is directly linked to Maastricht by train.
                • Other Options: Brussels Airport (BRU) is another great choice, especially if you are flying from East
                Coast U.S. cities, while Frankfurt (FRA) is ideal for those with flights from the U.S. that may have
                fewer options into Amsterdam or Brussels.</p>
